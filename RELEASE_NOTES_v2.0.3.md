## 🔥 **CRITICAL DIALOG FIX**: File Type Options Now Visible!

### 🐛 **Issue Identified:**
You were seeing a white dialog box with title and text but **NO clickable options** - this was because the `setItems()` method wasn't properly displaying the file type list on your device.

### ✅ **What I Fixed:**
- **🔧 REPLACED setItems() Dialog** - Changed from list-based dialog to individual button dialog
- **📄 Visible File Type Buttons** - Now shows "Documents", "Any File", and "More Options" buttons
- **🎯 Alternative Dialog Approach** - Uses setPositiveButton/setNeutralButton/setNegativeButton instead
- **🆘 Long-Press Backup** - Added long-press on "Upload File" button for direct file picker access
- **📂 Multiple Dialog Flow** - "More Options" shows additional file types (Spreadsheets, Images, Multiple Files)

### 🚀 **How It Works Now:**

#### What You Should See:
1. Click "Upload File" button
2. **Dialog appears with 3 VISIBLE BUTTONS:**
   - **"📄 Documents"** (left button)
   - **"📱 Any File"** (middle button) 
   - **"More Options"** (right button)
3. Click any button ➜ Opens appropriate file picker
4. If you click "More Options" ➜ Shows second dialog with more file types

#### Backup Method:
- **Long-press "Upload File" button** ➜ Directly opens file picker (bypasses dialog completely)

## 🎯 **Testing Instructions:**

### Primary Test:
1. Go to "Files & Images" tab
2. Click "Upload File" button
3. **SHOULD NOW SEE**: Dialog with 3 clickable buttons (not just text)
4. Click "📄 Documents" ➜ File browser opens
5. Select a file ➜ Should upload successfully

### Backup Test:
1. **Long-press** the "Upload File" button
2. **SHOULD SEE**: Toast message "Opening file picker directly..."
3. File browser opens immediately
4. Select any file ➜ Should upload successfully

### Alternative Options Test:
1. Click "Upload File" ➜ Dialog with 3 buttons appears
2. Click "More Options" ➜ Second dialog appears
3. **SHOULD SEE**: "Spreadsheets", "Images", "Multiple Files" buttons
4. Click any ➜ Appropriate file picker opens

## 💡 **Technical Details:**
- **Replaced AlertDialog.setItems()** with setPositiveButton/setNeutralButton/setNegativeButton
- **Two-dialog approach** to fit all file types
- **Long-press listener** as backup method
- **Exception handling** with direct file picker fallback

## 🚨 **THIS SHOULD FIX THE INVISIBLE OPTIONS ISSUE!**
If you were seeing just text with no buttons/options, you should now see actual clickable buttons in the dialog.

**The file upload functionality should finally work as intended!**
